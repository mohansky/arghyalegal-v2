title: "Dispute resolution"
subtitle: In our roles as in-house counsel in the past, we understand that litigation affects the bottom line of a company and the best way to resolve disputes of any kind is by way of mediation and negotiation as a first step. Our first approach during a possible litigious situation is always to facilitate mediation and guide both parties by becoming the mediator to help reach an amicable settlement.

In our roles as in-house counsel in the past, we understand that litigation affects the bottom line of a company and the best way to resolve disputes of any kind is by way of mediation and negotiation as a first step. Our first approach during a possible litigious situation is always to facilitate mediation and guide both parties by becoming the mediator to help reach an amicable settlement.

Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, we do collaborate with business though inhouse legal teams during such foreseeable litigation scenarios to guide and assist the business:
    
  - The right way to correspond.
  - Collation of relevant documents.
  - Work on strategy and preparedness to handle actual litigation in future.
  - Finding the right effective resource/counsel for matters in courts.
  - Strategic advice for ongoing litigations.
  - Overall litigation management. This means we take the responsibility of following up with external counsels and provide updates at regular intervals to our clients
     
Our lawyers have the experience and exposure nationally to  find the right resource at short notice as we understand the importance of time and quick action for favourable results during such situations.
